# advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [marknp][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, Marion is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

Disclaimer: this is my very first excercises in kotlin, I try to go towards idiomatic kotlin, but mainly I try to get familiar with the language, so I am ware that things are not perfect at all

If you are stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:

- [Kotlin Slack][slack]

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
